# Rust in a Week

## Overview

The goal is to go from minimal knowledge to basic Rust proficiency in a week,
publishing a summary video every day.

I'll be using two main resources:

* [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
* [Rust by Example](http://rustbyexample.com/)

My position at the start of this project is a lot of experience in other system
languages, and more modern higher level languages.  I've played around with
Rust in the past, without serious work.

The videos will be published to a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSeig21vs6mMfDB36BLFO3FH9TunZbyct).

## Format

Each video will address some chapters from the official documentation,
applying them with small code examples.  We will conclude with a project
incorporating the newly learnt features.  For each, runnable code will be
pushed to the [Github Repository](https://github.com/beneills/rust-in-a-week).
